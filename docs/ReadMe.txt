Summary

This file contains brief information on the SMPTE Sync library.

//**********
What is the SMPTE Sync Library?

SMPTE Sync is a code framework and implementation of the necessary components to
implement the SMPTE ST 430-14 D-Cinema Operations â€“ Digital Sync Signal 
and Aux Data Transfer Protocol.

This library can be used as a reference implementation or test framework to validate 
other implementations of the SMPTE ST 430-14 specification.

Several source files under src/server/SS are copied from the Boost Software
Library and are licensed under the license at src/server/SS/LICENSE_1_0.txt.

//********************
What else is required?

SMPTE Sync depends on external third party libraries. The libraries that are
used are ASDCPLib, Boost, TinyXML and Google Test.

ASCDPLib and TinyXML are managed as submodules. They are downloaded when
cloning the repo using `git clone --recurse-submodules` or after cloning using
`git submodule init; git submodule update`.

Google Test is automatically installed by the build script.

Boost needs to be available.

//********************
Build system

CMake is used to build the library.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest

//*******************
Windows-specific instructions:

The Boost_INCLUDE_DIR needs to be set to the location where the boost library was installed.

//**********
Linux-specific instructions

The Boost library can be installed as follows:

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
