         * Algorithm
         *
         * As soon as the lead sample struture for the sync marker is found
         * accumulate a frame's worth of samples.
         * Once you have a frames's worth of samples with the lead sample structure
         * of the sync marker as the first 3 bytes of the buffer,
         * then check to see if we have the tail sample structure for the sync marker.
         *
         * If we find a valid lead and tail sync marker as the first 2 samples (6 bytes),
         * then we validate there are no other sync markers (lead & tail) in the buffer.
         *
         * Once we have validated the buffered frame has the right sync markers,
         * then validate the length, followed by the payload (determined by the lenght),
         * followed by fill samples (padding, 0s) for the remaining frame.
         *
         * Once all of these have been validated, the frame is considered valid.
         *
         * If the frame fails to be valid there are several cases:
         *
         * Case 1: Multiple sync markers (could be caused by dropped buffers)
         * Solution 1: Skip to the last valid sync marker in the frame
         *             and accumulate more samples to fill the buffer.
         *
         * Case 2: Invalid payload - wrong length, mismatching lead vs. tail strutures
         * Solution 2: Skip the frame and look for new sync marker.
         *
         * Case 3: Invalid fill samples - not all 0s in the fill samples
         * Solution 3: Skip the frame and look for new sync marker.
         *
         * There are several cases we need to support for finding the sync marker
         *
         * Case 1: Sync marker is somwhere in the audio buffer.
         *         This could be at the first sample of an audio buffer or later in audio buffer.
         *
         * Case 2: Sync marker is at the very last sample of the audio buffer.
         *         In this case, the lead sample of the sync marker is in one audio buffer
         *         and the tail sample of the sync marker is the first sample in the next audio buffer.
